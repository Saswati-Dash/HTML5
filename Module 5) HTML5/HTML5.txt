1. What are the new tags added in HTML5?
HTML5 introduced several new tags to enhance the structure, semantics, and functionality of web documents. Here are some of the key new tags:

Structural and Semantic Tags:

- <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be independently distributable or reusable.

- <section>: Defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.

- <nav>: Defines a section that contains navigation links.

- <aside>: Represents content tangentially related to the content around it (like a sidebar).

- <header>: Represents the introductory content or a set of navigational links.

- <footer>: Represents the footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.

- <main>: Represents the dominant content of the <body>.

- <figure>: Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

- <figcaption>: Defines a caption for a <figure> element.

- <mark>: Represents text highlighted for reference or notation purposes.

- <time>: Represents a specific period in time.

Media Tags:
----------
- <audio>: Embeds sound content.
- <video>: Embeds video content.
- <source>: Specifies multiple media resources for <audio> and <video>.
- <track>: Defines text tracks for <video> and <audio> (e.g., subtitles, captions).

Form Tags:
------------
- <datalist>: Specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element.
- <keygen>: Facilitates generating a key pair in forms (now deprecated).
- <output>: Represents the result of a calculation or user action.

Graphics Tags:
-----------
- <canvas>: Provides a space on the web page where you can draw graphics using JavaScript.
- <svg>: Embeds Scalable Vector Graphics content.


2. How to embed audio and video in a webpage?

- Embedding Audio
------------
To embed audio in a webpage, use the <audio> tag. You can specify multiple sources with different formats to ensure compatibility across browsers.

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio-file.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

- Embedding Video
------------
To embed video in a webpage, use the <video> tag. Similarly, multiple sources can be specified.

<video width="600" controls>
  <source src="video-file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="video-file.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

3.Semantic Elements in HTML5
Semantic elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Here are some of the key semantic elements introduced in HTML5:

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>

4.Canvas and SVG Tags

Canvas :-
The <canvas> element is used for drawing graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript). It is a raster-based (pixel-based) graphics solution.


SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) :-
The <svg> element is used to define vector-based graphics. SVG images can be scaled to any size without losing quality.
